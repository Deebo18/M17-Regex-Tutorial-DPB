# M17-Regex-Tutorial-DPB

Developers write code, but they also write about code. The goal of this tutorial is to explain how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions. Below we will be selecting one regex and breaking down each part of its parts and describing their functions.

## Summary

`/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/` 

Regular expressions, or regex for short, are a series of special characters that define a search pattern. In this tutorial we are trying to validate if the input is a URL
